# my-first-github
=============================================

It is my first usage of git and github.
================================================

1.git init:Use this command line to initialize a folder so that we can lock our file operations inside github.

2.git add:Use this to add some files or folder to git,and we can push or record our new changes.

3.git commit -m <>:For this, it is used to record our changes descriptions for specific files.

4.git remote add origin <>:connect our github account and lock into our specific respository.

5.git push -u origin master:push our project to github,so our teammates and other people could see and download,next time while we update some files inside this project locally, we can just use "git push original master", it would automatically update new file in github.

6.when we wanna copy or download some resporistories in github online, we could use this command.
